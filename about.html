<h1>About</h1>
<p>I'm passionate about making the world a better place.
  There is no better way to to this than to help others.</br>
  There are any ways to do this but i chose upon having a charity.</br>
  Based in Kitengela,I occasionaly do travel around trying to help people.</br>
  I'm currently studying at Kenyatta University taking Computer SCience as a major.</br>
  This has waved the way into a myriad of opportunities at the higher level which</br>
  means doing a lot of coding trying to find solutions to everyday  problems.</br>
  With some experience in Java and Python I believe this is the first among many</br>
  to a carrer in programming. In addition to the normal degree,I have enrolled in</br>
  institutions such as Moringa School to better myself in coding and gain more</br>
  experience.
