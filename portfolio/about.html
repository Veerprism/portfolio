<div class="about">
<p>I'm passionate about making the world a better place.
  There is no better way to to this than to help others.
  There are any ways to do this but i chose upon having a charity.
  Based in <span class="important">Kitengela</span>,I occasionaly do travel around trying to help people.
  I'm currently studying at <span class="important">Kenyatta University</span> taking Computer Science as a major.
  This has waved the way into a myriad of opportunities at the higher level which
  means doing a lot of coding trying to find solutions to everyday  problems.
  With some experience in <span class="important">Java</span> and Python I believe this is the first among many
  to a carrer in programming. In addition to the normal degree,I have enrolled in
  institutions such as Moringa School to better myself in coding and gain more
  experience.Also being in provident in other areas like First Aids which is a nice way
  of helping people with a certificate of St.John's Ambulance medical which is
  is always an advantage in emergency situations. I like the image of an owl because it represents
  emblematic of a deep connection with wisdom and intuitive knowledge. Learning is an endless process
  therefore it's always a good thing to aspire to learn something new each day. I can consider myself as a
 a ‘forever student,’ eager to both build on her academic foundations in psychology and sociology and stay
   in tune with the latest digital marketing strategies through continued coursework and professional development.This is <thead>
     beginning of the end .
